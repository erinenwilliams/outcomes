## Student Employment with Jeff Casimir

### Jobs & Job Hunters

Hiring has been going quite well for the majority of graduates. We continue
to see some students accepting job offers before completing the program and
many others signing within 30 days of graduation.

* The XX students in Module 4 begin job hunting this week
* A total of XX job hunters

### Our Structures/Processes

( Needs update )

* From a staffing standpoint, Lia James started with us last week to take over
most of the hiring and partnerships work.
* We held a hiring event Monday that went well and led to several follow-up interviews. We spent intermission week at RailsConf where we connected with several companies who are interested in hiring.
* We're working to better organize our alumni data so we can better stay in touch
with companies that've hired from us before.
* I'm stepping back into a teaching role but trying to keep the jobs momentum by handing pieces over to Lia

### Goals

( Needs update )

* We're going to put extra energy into the six long-term job hunters with the goal of finding at least four of them employment
* Finally put into place a meaningful system to track students' job applications/outreach
* Get below 5 alumni looking for a first job offer before 1511 graduates

## Staffing with Jeff Casimir

( Needs update )

* Jorge is not teaching, instead focusing on recruitment and other business processes
* Josh Cheek is still in Chicago and looks to return sometime this summer
* Beth Sebian from 1510 has taken over the student support fellowship
* Heidi, Julian

We're currently looking for:

* ~5 lead and supporting instructors for the front end program
