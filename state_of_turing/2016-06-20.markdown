a waiting list. Front-end has 14 students and is expected to start with about 18.
* Total new student enrollment for August will be about 42 of a possible 48
* Enrollments for the next cohorts are starting to trickle in.

* We've tentatively scheduled 1-2 Try Turing events per month for the rest of the year
* We're in the process of planning and registering for several local jobs events
* We decided to end the paid student referral program to be in full compliance with the Veterans Administration guidelines
* We expect final approval from the VA by the end of the module and can start accepting GI Bill funding shortly thereafter

## Student Employment with Jeff Casimir

### Jobs & Job Hunters

Hiring has been going quite well for the majority of graduates. We continue
to see some students accepting job offers before completing the program and
many others signing within 30 days of graduation.

We currently have:

* 18 graduates hunting for their first job offer
* Of those 11 graduated in the most recent cohort
* 5 graduated with the previous cohort
* 2 students are near or over 90 days of job hunting post-graduation
* 2 additional students are hunting for a second job
* Overall 20 alumni are job hunting
* The 21 students in Module 4 begin job hunting this week
* A total of 41 job hunters

### Goals & Notes

* We issued tuition refunds to two alumni who wanted to give up on job hunting
* The last job hunter from the 2015 graduates found a job, so 100% are employed, refunded, or exempt
* Overall job hunting continues to go well this Spring/Summer
* We're seeing an increasing number of students getting/evaluating multiple offers
* We are working to develop more partnerships for the late summer
* We are reworking how we run PR and outreach to better connect with employers
* Continue to have good public conversation about our outcomes report and overall transparency initiative
