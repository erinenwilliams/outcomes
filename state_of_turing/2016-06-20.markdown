five instructors, the "Spirit Team", including Brenna, Jhun, Louisa, Meeka, and me.

## Enrollments & Admissions

### Enrollments Snapshot

* The 1606 backend cohort begins with XX students, XX slots below full enrollment
* The 1606 frontend cohort begins with XX students, XX slots below full enrollment
* As we exit the early-summer seasonal dip, the 1608 backend cohort is full with
a waiting list. Front-end has XX students and is expected to start with about XX.
* Enrollments for the next cohorts are starting to trickle in
* Try Turing was radically successful, yielding over 20 accepted students
* We've tentatively scheduled 1-2 Try Turing events per month for the rest of the year
* Erin

#### Web Application Development

Enrollments for the existing program are running "ok". With some applicants
still selecting their cohort, we currently have:

* 1606 has 14 students enrolled
* 1608 has 13 students enrolled

1606 is slightly under-enrolled. 1608 is on track for full enrollment.

#### Front-End Engineering

* 1606 has 8 students enrolled
* 1608 has 4 students enrolled

As we ramp up the new program we expect the first few cohorts to be under-enrolled.
Likely they'll start with 16-18 students.

### Applications Snapshot

Applications continue to be a bit slow:

* 0 applications are awaiting evaluation
* 9 students have pending interviews
* ~6 students have been invited but have not yet selected/enrolled in a cohort

### Enrollments/Applications Pipelines

Last module we made some small strides in student recruitment, but have not
seen dramatic changes. This module we will:

* Hire a recruitment/admissions coordinator to focus on it full time
* Hold a handful of recruitment events for partner organizations
* Draft a more comprehensive strategy

## Student Employment

### Jobs & Job Hunters

Hiring has been going quite well for the majority of graduates. We continue
to see some students accepting job offers before completing the program and
many others signing within 30 days of graduation.

We currently have:

* 26 graduates hunting for their first job offer
* Of those 15 graduated in the most recent cohort
* 5 graduated with the previous cohort
* 6 students are near or over 90 days of job hunting post-graduation
* 3 additional students are hunting for a second job
* Overall 29 alumni are job hunting
* The 16 students in Module 4 begin job hunting this week
* A total of 45 job hunters

### Our Structures/Processes

* From a staffing standpoint, Lia James started with us last week to take over
most of the hiring and partnerships work.
* We held a hiring event Monday that went well and led to several follow-up interviews. We spent intermission week at RailsConf where we connected with several companies who are interested in hiring.
* We're working to better organize our alumni data so we can better stay in touch
with companies that've hired from us before.
* I'm stepping back into a teaching role but trying to keep the jobs momentum by handing pieces over to Lia

### Goals

* We're going to put extra energy into the six long-term job hunters with the goal of finding at least four of them employment
* Finally put into place a meaningful system to track students' job applications/outreach
* Get below 5 alumni looking for a first job offer before 1511 graduates

## Staffing

Other notes:

* Steve is not assigned to a module this session as he prep's for the Front-End program
* Jorge is not teaching, instead focusing on recruitment and other business processes
* Josh Cheek is still in Chicago and looks to return sometime this summer
* Rachel Martinez and Marissa are both returning from maternity leave
* Beth Sebian from 1510 has taken over the student support fellowship

We're currently looking for:

* ~5 lead and supporting instructors for the front end program
* A recruitment/admissions coordinator

## Academic & Program Changes

### Posse Reboot

* We were happy with the first round of the posse reformation
* Module 1 students seem generally a little out of place
* Going to experiment with Module 1 students not being expected (though still allowed)
to join posses
* Instead form M1 students into "micro-posses" for 3-4 students with the goal
of reducing their feeling of being overwhelmed but still providing support
* Ideally attach 1-2 mentors (from alums, students, and traditional mentors) to each micro-posse

### Friday Restructuring

* Yet Another Friday Plan
* Weekends are typically full of work
* Acknowledge Thursday as a time for renewal/celebration
* Experiment with starting Fridays at 10AM
* Moving Guest Talks to 9AM and making them optional
* 10:00-11:30 will be Academic Time
* 11:30 to 12:30 will have Lightning Talks and Side-Hustle/Posse Demos on weeks 1, 3, and 5
* 11:30 to 12:30 will have Gear Up on weeks 2 and 4
* 12:30-1:30 Lunch
* 1:30-2:30 Retro, including more frequent paired or small-group retro
* 2:30-4:00 Outreach, Student-Led Sessions, and Side Project work time

### Final Friday

* Last retro of the module is to "increase the gravity" of the group
* More about the members, less about the structure/content/instruction
* Module 4 retro has gone well in that way with the Fishbowl
* Working to create different but similarly feedback-driven activities for the other modules

## Whatâ€™s Next

* Gala on June 25th
* The new office process is grinding along. We've got a floor plan done and are
in the processes of pricing out the construction and putting together the contract. It's probably ~2 weeks away from signed papers.
* More than likely the front-end program will start in temporary space nearby
* Questions?
