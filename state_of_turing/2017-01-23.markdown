## Staffing with Jeff Casimir

This inning we've got a bunch of people changing responsibilities:

* Erin Williams goes from Admissions & Enrollment Coordinator to Admissions & Enrollment Manager
* Jorge TÃ©llez has returned from paternity leave back to his role as the Director of Growth & Operations
* Ellen Mary Hickmann goes from Instructional Development Manager to Director of Professional Learning
* Steve Kinney goes on leave for a module
* Meeka Gayhart goes from Instructor to Director of Front End Engineering
* Brenna Martenson goes from Assistant Instructor to Associate Instructor
* Jhun de Andres goes from Assistant Instructor to Associate Instructor
* Louisa Barrett goes from Instructor to Instructor & Design Curriculum Lead
* Sal Espinosa goes from Teaching Assistant to Assistant Instructor
* Lauren Fazah goes from Teaching Assistant to Associate Instructor
* Beth Sebian goes from Assistant Instructor to Associate Instructor & Gear Up Lead
* Andrea Moreno, formerly Chief of Staff, has departed
* Amy Stokke, formerly Facilities Coordinator, has departed

What will probably stand out to you most is that Steve, having spent most of the last year working way far too many hours to launch the front-end program, is taking a well deserved break for the whole inning. Meeka will be stepping into both the Director role and laying out the vision for Front-End Mod 4.
